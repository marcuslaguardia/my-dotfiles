This repository is where I store my personal configuration for [Neovim], [tmux], etc. Feel free to replicate my settings.

## Neovim
I use [LazyVim] with some minor changes. Most of things are provided by LazyVim out of the box. The changes include:
- [Catppuccin] as the default colorscheme;
- [vim-tmux-navigator] for a smoother navigation with tmux;
- Extra remaps.

[Catppuccin]: https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim
[vim-tmux-navigator]: https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator

## tmux
My tmux configuration includes:
- ``history-limit`` set to ``10000``;
- ``C-Space`` as the new prefix;
- Plugins like [vim-tmux-navigator] and [Catppuccin] for theming.
